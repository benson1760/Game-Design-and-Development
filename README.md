Project Details

During the course of my  semester at KSU. For our project, we had to design and develop a simple game. For my game, I decide to develop a space shooter.
If you are interested in space shooting games and is stimulated by sky shooters, then Universe Defender is the game for you. To accomplish the mission, you must have the strength to endure this high paced action shooter.


Game Summary
 In this shooter game, the player will be challenged by an immense number of enemies flying toward you in an arcade style type shooter. 
As the player progresses in the game, they will be introduced/learn how to upgrade their space arsenal in order to fully bring out the massive but extremely deadly capabilities of the Star-ship. Use the keyboard keys to move and destroy your enemies. 
The goal will be quite a challenging one as you will have to defend the universe from evil space tyrants. The objective of the game is to destroy as many enemies hurling towards you while using your power-ups to fight against the enemies to gain a high score.
          On-board your star-ship as you will have to defeat a huge number of enemies and trying to destroy you. Are you skilled enough to analyze the patterns and develop a strategy to tackle this task...? Dare to Try?!!
